Robison Jeffers once said, \"Big Sur is the greatest meeting of land and sea in the world,\" but the highlights are only accessible on foot.\\nOur 3-day tour allows you to choose from multiple hikes led by experienced guides during the day, while comfortably situated in the evenings at the historic Big Sur River Inn. Take a tranquil walk to the coastal waterfall at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Par or hike to the Married Redwoods. If you're prepared for a more strenuous climb, try Ollason's Peak in Toro Park. An optional 4th day includes admission to the Henry Miller Library and the Point Reyes Lighthouse.  \n","1  John Muir famously walked from San Francisco to Yosemite, an astounding 300 miles, and this tour is designed to trace his steps-- at least part of the way.\\nThis tour is not for the faint of heart though. This is a true backpacker's adventure, 37 miles in 3 days. Along the way, you'll bear witness to the classic monuments of Yosemite, such as Vernal Falls, Nevada Falls, Half Dome, Cathedral Peak, Tuolumne Meadows and Mt. Lyell. At Nevada Falls, the trail becomes narrow and from then on, you'll be privy to a \"secret\" Yosemite, including a rarely seen face of Half Dome. John Muir Trail tickets are required- and hard to come by- but Explore California has you covered. We'll also provide a checklist so that you come prepared with the right equipment and a seasoned guide for your tour.  \n","2                        This 2 day, 1 night tour takes you deep into the heart of Death Valley National Park. Due to extreme temperatures (120 degrees and higher) in the summer months, this tour is only offered November through April. \\nThis overnighter is no picnic though. Our guide will lead you on a 12 mile, off-trail hike down Death Valley Wash and into the backcountry for an overnight, hard terrain camping. Luckily, 12 miles takes you out of range of almost any city lights, something that draws thousands of star gazers to Death Valley ever year. If you can survive the 12 miles back, take advantage of the location to stop in at Scotty's Castle, a genuine castle built by the eccentric and wealthy Walter Scott for his wife. This tour will make you truly appreciate modern luxuries.  \n","3                                                         Backpackers and hikers taking the Mt. Whitney Climbers Tour won't need hooks and rappelling gear, but they will need to be on the look out for majestic sunrises, giant granite peaks and everything from brown bears to marmots. You'll approach the towering peak from the trailhead on the western face, starting 6,000 feet above sea level. The Mt. Whitney Trail extends 11 miles and another 8 feet up to the peak. While no expensive training is required, you'll still need planning, permits, and preparation. Explore California will set you up with a trail permit, a two night camping pass, and an expert guide. We'll also help outfit you with the correct gear and make sure you are prepared for the length and elevation gain of the climb.  \n","4  The Channel Islands Excursion starts with a ferry from beautiful Ventura to the nearest island in the strand, Santa Cruz. You'll spend the day wandering the rocky coasts, sea anemone and barnacle studded shoreline, and wildflower-strewn meadows of the islands. Visit the herd of wild buffalo housed on Santa Catalina and keep an eye peeled for the endangered island fox. Take a break for lunch on Catalina in the quaint, turn of the century styled Avalon and make sure to visit the Art Deco Catalina Casino. Before ferrying home, visit the botanical gardens or climb to one of the islands' high points and do some inexpensive whale watching. Blue whale season extends the late spring through summer months. (The Whaling Tour, run by Island Packers, is also available for an additional cost.)

This tour includes a 4 full day lift pass, so when you're ready, you can take on any one of the 150 trails over Mammoth's epic terrain. Equipment rentals are included, so you can pack light. Need a break? Take a scenic gondola to the summit of Mammoth Mountain, 11,000 feet in all, or take a Snowcat tour of the backcountry. Enjoy dinners at the Mammoth Mountain Inn, a snowball's throw from the main lodge, where you'll also be provided 3 night's complimentary lodging. This package is available October through early June, but lift tickets are rare, so book now.
