Radiant Glow Highlighting Powder,This powder is awful! It clumps and looks chalky on the skin. Not the radiant glow I was hoping for.
LushLips Matte Lipstick in Cherry Bliss,"The color is beautiful, but it's so drying on the lips. Will not be repurchasing."
VividEyes Intense Mascara in Jet Black,Clumpy and smudges easily. I looked like a raccoon by the end of the day. Highly disappointed.
SkinPerfector BB Cream in Medium,It's okay. Doesn't provide much coverage and feels a bit oily. Good for a light makeup day.
ShineNoMore Oil Control Setting Spray,"My makeup stayed put all day! However, it does have a strong chemical smell."
UltraSoft Beauty Blender Sponge,Terrible quality. It fell apart after just a few uses. Definitely not worth the price.
GlamBrow Precision Eyebrow Pencil in Ash Brown,"It's alright, but not the best. The pencil tip breaks easily and the shade is a bit off."
Nourish+ Hydrating Face Primer,Simply amazing! My foundation glides on smoothly with this primer. A new staple in my routine.
PopColor Cream Blush in Rosy Pink,"The color fades too quickly. By lunchtime, I couldn't even tell I had put it on."
ClearSkin Pore Minimizing Foundation,Didn't minimize pores at all. It actually accentuated them and left my skin looking patchy.
GlowUp Liquid Highlighter in Moonlight,"It's way too glittery for my liking. Instead of a glow, I looked like a disco ball. Not for me."
VelvetTouch Lip Liner in Cocoa Rose,"The color is stunning, but the formula drags and isn't smooth. Difficult to get a precise line."
FlawlessFinish Mineral Powder Foundation,It's just average. Didn't live up to the hype for me. I found it a bit cakey on my combination skin.
MesmerEyes Liquid Eyeliner in Onyx,"Finally, an eyeliner that doesn't smudge on my oily eyelids! It stays put all day. Totally in love."
NaturePure Cleansing Face Wash,"It dried out my skin terribly. I had high hopes but was left with a tight, uncomfortable feeling."
SunKissed Bronzing Palette,The shades are not pigmented enough and they blend into a muddy mess. Definitely not recommended.
SmoothSilk Eye Primer Potion,"It's okay. Does make eyeshadows pop more, but creases by the end of the day."
HydraBoost Moisturizing Night Cream,I woke up with soft and plump skin. The texture is a bit heavy but it's perfect for nighttime hydration.
StayAllDay Setting Powder in Translucent,It made my under eyes look super dry and aged. Not a fan of this product at all.
PureBliss Organic Face Serum with Vitamin E,I didn't notice any difference after using it for a month. The scent is pleasant but that's about it.
DreamyDew Hydration Mist with Lavender,The scent is overpowering and gives me a headache. Doesn't feel hydrating either.
LuxLash Volumizing Mascara in Charcoal,It's just okay. Gives volume but dries out quickly and flakes by afternoon.
SilkyMatte Liquid Lip in Coral Dreams,"Loved the color, but it's not transfer-proof. Left marks on my coffee cup."
RefreshMe Under-eye Brightening Cream,"It did reduce puffiness, but no impact on my dark circles. Still searching for the perfect product."
SeamlessCover Full Coverage Concealer,It settled into my fine lines and looked patchy after a few hours. Not impressed.
GoldenHour Bronzer Stick,Easy to apply and blends seamlessly. Perfect for that sun-kissed look!
PoreVanish Face Primer,It felt greasy on my skin and didn't hold up my foundation well. I'll pass.
EternalGlow Illuminating Eye Serum,"Lightweight and absorbs quickly. However, the results are not noticeable."
VelvetFinish Blush Palette in Sunset Hues,Colors are beautiful but not long-lasting. They faded within a few hours.
BerryBurst Antioxidant Face Mask,"It tingles a bit, but my skin looked brighter after use. Smells delicious too!"
SkinEssence Calming Toner with Chamomile,"It's gentle on the skin, but I didn't notice any significant improvement. It's just okay."
LuxeLines Liquid Eyebrow Pen in Espresso,"The color is good, but it fades throughout the day. Needs regular touch-ups."
VelvetSkin Pressed Powder in Alabaster,"Blends nicely and offers a good matte finish. However, the compact broke easily in my bag."
FreshFace Detoxifying Clay Mask,"The mask feels refreshing, but it's a bit hard to wash off. Skin feels smooth afterward though."
ColorLock Long-Wear Eyeshadow Quad in Mauve Moods,"Decent pigmentation. The shimmer shades are a bit chalky, but the mattes are smooth."
PureShine Lip Gloss in Peach Perfection,Love the color and shine! Just wish it was a bit less sticky.
Rejuvenate Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30,"A solid daily moisturizer. The SPF is a plus, but it does leave a slight white cast."
SculptMaster Contour Kit,"The shades are versatile, but the highlighter isn't as glowy as I'd like. Overall, not bad."
NourishMe Eye Cream with Caffeine,"It's hydrating and feels nice. I haven't seen major changes, but it's a good basic eye cream."
AquaPlush Hyaluronic Acid Serum,Amazing for hydration! It sinks in quickly and layers well with other products. A staple in my routine now.
UltraLift Firming Neck Cream,"Feels luxurious on the skin, but I haven't noticed any firming effects yet. Maybe it needs more time?"

VividMatte Lipstick in Berry Bold,"Beautiful color, but it's a bit drying. I need to use a lip balm underneath."
LushLids Eyeshadow Primer,"Works decently for the price. Eyeshadow lasts longer, but there's some minor creasing by evening."

ColorPop Blush Stick in Coral Craze,"The formula is creamy and easy to blend. However, the staying power is just average."
DermaDefense SPF 50 Sunscreen,"It offers good sun protection, but it's a bit thick. It leaves a slight white residue which isn't ideal."
Twilight Tones Eyeshadow Palette,"The dark shades are patchy, but the shimmers are absolutely stunning. It's a mixed bag."
AquaWave Hydrating Gel Mask,"It's cooling and pleasant to use after a long day. Makes my skin feel refreshed, but the hydration doesn't last long."
SilkFinish Liquid Foundation in Warm Beige,"Coverage is buildable and it feels light on the skin. However, I noticed it oxidizes a bit after a few hours."
Radiant Glow Highlighting Powder,This highlighter is subtle and perfect for everyday use. I just wish it had a more intense shine for special occasions.
LushLips Matte Lipstick in Cherry Bliss,"Although the shade is to die for, I wish it wasn't so drying. It's best used with a lip primer or balm."
VividEyes Intense Mascara in Jet Black,"Great for volume, but I experienced some clumping. It's best applied with a light hand."
SkinPerfector BB Cream in Medium,"It provides decent coverage for a BB cream. A bit on the dewy side, so I need to set it with powder."
ShineNoMore Oil Control Setting Spray,"It does control oil pretty well, but the nozzle sprays unevenly. I hope they improve the packaging."
UltraSoft Beauty Blender Sponge,"It blends foundation seamlessly, but it's a bit hard to clean. Makeup stains don't come off easily."
GlamBrow Precision Eyebrow Pencil in Ash Brown,The fine tip is perfect for precise application. The spoolie at the other end is a bonus. Just wish it lasted longer throughout the day.
Nourish+ Hydrating Face Primer,"I love the hydration it offers. It might not suit super oily skin types, but it's perfect for my dry skin."
PopColor Cream Blush in Rosy Pink,It's a lovely color for spring and summer. The formula is creamy but can be a bit challenging to blend over powder.
ClearSkin Pore Minimizing Foundation,"It gives a smooth finish initially, but by mid-day, my pores are visible. Might work better with a good primer."
Radiant Glow Highlighting Powder,"It's decent for the price point. It doesn't emphasize texture on the skin, but I do need to reapply to keep the glow."
LushLips Matte Lipstick in Cherry Bliss,"The formula glides on smoothly. It's not transfer-proof, but the shade is so stunning I don't mind reapplying."
VividEyes Intense Mascara in Jet Black,"It does lengthen lashes, but be cautious with application to avoid spider lashes. Overall, a good buy for the price."
SkinPerfector BB Cream in Medium,"Great for a natural look. It evens out the skin tone, but blemishes still need a concealer."
ShineNoMore Oil Control Setting Spray,"It's a summer staple for me. Controls oil decently, but the scent could be improved."
UltraSoft Beauty Blender Sponge,"It does a decent job, but it feels a tad harder than other sponges I've tried. It's durable, though."
GlamBrow Precision Eyebrow Pencil in Ash Brown,"It's easy to use, especially for brow beginners. I wish they provided more product for the price."
Nourish+ Hydrating Face Primer,"It hydrates without feeling greasy. It makes the foundation application smoother, but not sure it extends wear time."
PopColor Cream Blush in Rosy Pink,"Perfect for a natural flush. It's buildable, so you can go from subtle to intense with a few layers."
ClearSkin Pore Minimizing Foundation,"It's lightweight and blends easily. Doesn't completely hide pores but gives a natural, semi-matte finish."
Radiant Glow Highlighting Powder,"This powder provides a subtle shimmer, making it ideal for everyday wear. I love the soft glow it imparts, but I do wish it was a tad more intense for evening events."
LushLips Matte Lipstick in Cherry Bliss,"Its velvety texture is a dream to apply, giving rich color payoff in just one swipe. The shade is absolutely stunning. The only drawback? It's not completely smudge-proof, so touch-ups are a must."
VividEyes Intense Mascara in Jet Black,"The brush design separates and coats each lash beautifully. It does offer noticeable lengthening, but over-application can lead to clumps. For its price point, it's a solid choice."
SkinPerfector BB Cream in Medium,"For days when I'm aiming for a 'no-makeup' look, this is my go-to. It evens out skin tone effectively, but if you have significant blemishes, additional concealer is needed."
ShineNoMore Oil Control Setting Spray,"This setting spray has been a lifesaver during hot summer days. It does a commendable job at oil control, but the initial scent is a bit strong, which might be off-putting for some."
UltraSoft Beauty Blender Sponge,"It's slightly denser compared to other market leaders, but it gets the job done. What I appreciate is its durability, even after several washes. Good value for money."
GlamBrow Precision Eyebrow Pencil in Ash Brown,"The fine tip allows for precise strokes, making it easier to mimic natural brow hairs. The shade suits me well, but I do find the need to reapply in the evening."
Nourish+ Hydrating Face Primer,"Its hydrating properties shine through, making foundation application a breeze. My skin feels plump and prepped, but I haven't noticed a significant extension in makeup wear time."
PopColor Cream Blush in Rosy Pink,"Its creamy texture melts into the skin, offering a radiant flush that looks incredibly natural. It's versatile and buildable, but those with oily skin might need to set it."
ClearSkin Pore Minimizing Foundation,"This foundation offers medium coverage, effectively blurring minor imperfections. While it doesn't erase pores completely, it provides a smooth, semi-matte finish that lasts through the day."
GlowUp Liquid Highlighter in Moonlight,"The liquid formula ensures seamless blending, giving the skin a dewy, ethereal glow. Moonlight is a flattering shade for most skin tones. Just be careful, a little goes a long way; overdoing it can lead to an excessive shine."
VelvetTouch Lip Liner in Cocoa Rose,Cocoa Rose is a versatile shade that pairs well with many lipsticks. The liner's formula is soft enough for easy application but firm enough to prevent breakage. My only wish? A built-in sharpener for convenience.
FlawlessFinish Mineral Powder Foundation,"For those who prefer a lightweight feel, this mineral powder foundation is a godsend. It offers buildable coverage, allowing for a natural or more polished look. Best for normal to oily skin types, as it might accentuate dry patches."
MesmerEyes Liquid Eyeliner in Onyx,"The Onyx shade is truly jet black and dries down to a lovely matte finish. The applicator tip allows for sharp, precise lines, making winged looks a breeze. Be patient during application; it takes a minute to fully dry."
NaturePure Cleansing Face Wash,"While the face wash effectively removes daily grime and makeup, those with sensitive skin might find it slightly drying. The natural ingredients are a plus, and it has a refreshingly clean scent."
SunKissed Bronzing Palette,"The palette offers a range of shades suitable for both contouring and bronzing. The powders are fairly blendable, but I'd advise using a light hand as they're quite pigmented. The mirror in the palette is a handy addition."
SmoothSilk Eye Primer Potion,"This primer sets a good base, enhancing the vibrancy of eyeshadows. While it does improve longevity, those with very oily lids might experience minimal creasing by day's end. Prepping with a setting powder can help."
HydraBoost Moisturizing Night Cream,"Rich and nourishing, this night cream feels like a treat for the skin. It might be too heavy for those with oily skin, but for dry or combination skin types, it's a dream, resulting in softer, plumper skin by morning."
StayAllDay Setting Powder in Translucent,"The powder sets makeup effectively, ensuring longevity. The translucent shade doesn't leave a white cast, but can slightly alter foundation shades if heavily applied. Best used with a fluffy brush and a light hand."
PureBliss Organic Face Serum with Vitamin E,"The serum feels luxurious and is packed with beneficial ingredients. Vitamin E helps combat free radicals, and with consistent use, there's a noticeable difference in skin texture. The dropper packaging ensures easy application."
AquaSplash Refreshing Facial Mist,"This facial mist is a true savior during hot days. One spritz instantly refreshes the skin. The light cucumber scent is invigorating, and it also sets makeup without making it look cakey."
NudePerfection Lip Tint in Barely There,"The 'Barely There' shade gives just the right hint of color for a natural look. The tint feels comfortable and is not overly drying. However, reapplication after meals is a must."
MysticEyes Eyeshadow Quad in Twilight Hues,"The shades in this quad are perfect for creating a sultry evening look. The shadows are creamy and blendable, with minimal fallout. I do wish the shimmer shades were more pigmented."
ReplenishMe Daily Vitamin C Serum,"This serum, with its potent vitamin C, has done wonders for my uneven skin tone. It's lightweight and absorbs quickly. There's a slight tingling upon application, but that subsides quickly."
GoldenAura Liquid Bronzer,"For a sun-kissed look without the sun's harmful rays, this product is a winner. It blends seamlessly and looks natural, without any orange undertones. Great for a touch of summer all year round."
PlushPout Hydrating Lip Balm in Tropical Punch,"Apart from the delicious tropical scent, this balm keeps my lips moisturized for hours. The subtle tint it imparts is an added bonus, making it perfect for those no-makeup days."
ClearVision Makeup Removing Balm,"Makeup melts away effortlessly with this balm, including stubborn waterproof mascara. It doesn't leave a greasy residue, but I still follow up with a cleanser. It's a must-have for makeup enthusiasts."
Luminesce Brightening Under-Eye Cream,"Dark circles have met their match. After a month of use, I've noticed a considerable lightening of my under-eye area. The cream is rich yet non-greasy and works well under makeup."
SilkSheen Body Lotion with Coconut Extract,"This body lotion leaves my skin feeling silky and hydrated. The coconut scent is not overpowering, making it a delightful post-shower treat. It absorbs quickly, ensuring no greasy feeling."
PrimeFocus Pore-Filling Face Primer,"Foundation glides on smoothly over this primer, and pores are noticeably blurred. It helps extend makeup wear time. However, those with dry skin might find it a tad mattifying."
